This system features： 6W solar panel A Primary LED Lamp With a Built-in Lithium Battery Pack Two Secondary LED Lamps. A Remote Control Torch. An AM/FM Radio The primary lamp offers three levels of brightness, and it is capable of illuminating a room. Meanwhile, the secondary lamps are smaller and offer lower brightness, making them suitable for lighting smaller spaces. Its torch can be used as a desk lamp, and as a remote control, to turn on/off the LED lamps and adjust brightness levels. The radio emits a sufficient volume for outdoor usage and supports compatibility with FM/AM, Mp3, and TF cards. This solar lights system is capable of providing simultaneous lighting for up to three rooms at night, thanks to the inclusion of the primary and secondary lamps. Furthermore, a power source for charging devices such as phones or radios. The lithium battery pack provides up to 5.5 hours of continuous lighting on a single charge, making it ideal for off-grid locations or areas with unreliable power grids. To ensure high-quality performance and reliability, the LUMN™ Solar Lights System has been rigorously tested and certified to meet IEC TS 62257-9-8 quality standards. Additionally, this product comes with a warranty, providing peace of mind to customers who may encounter issues with their system. For more detailed specifications and information, please refer to the datasheet, which includes information on the system's dimensions, weight, and operating temperature range.",

OVES intelligent battery swapping cabinet is composed of a series of cabinet control boards (including a cabinet control system), a charging module, a fire extinguisher, a cabinet body, and other intelligent devices. It can monitor the changes in current, voltage, power, and surrounding environment in the whole charging process in real-time, and determine whether there is any abnormality intelligently. Key Features: Convenience: These stations offer automated, hassle-free charging or battery swapping, saving users time and effort. Rapid Swapping: They facilitate swift battery replacement, enabling electric vehicles to quickly resume operation and enhance efficiency. Flexibility: Positioned strategically in key locations, they provide users with easy access to battery services, reducing concerns about charging infrastructure availability. Space Efficiency: Occupying minimal space, these stations are well-suited for urban environments with limited room, optimizing the use of public areas. Smart Management: Equipped with intelligent monitoring systems, these stations track battery status and transaction data, aiding operators in maintenance and management. Sustainability: Integration with renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, reduces reliance on conventional energy, promoting sustainable practices. Wide Applicability: Serving electric cars, bikes, and motorcycles, these stations cater to diverse electric transportation modes. Compatibility: Designed to accommodate various battery brands and models, they ensure broad compatibility for user convenience. Energy Efficiency: Through battery recycling and renewable energy utilization, smart stations minimize harmful emissions, contributing to environmental conservation. Economic Benefits: Operating costs are relatively low, and these stations can generate revenue for operators, offering economic advantages.",

All-in-one inverters offer a reliable and efficient alternative to traditional power generation methods, particularly in areas with unreliable or intermittent power supply. Key Features: Low no-load power loss, less than half of that of high-frequency machines with the same power. Pure sine wave output, adaptable to different loads. Output short-circuit protection function. Multiple parameters can be adjusted according to user requirements. MPPT solar controller. Equipped with BMS communication functionality.",
